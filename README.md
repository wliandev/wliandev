### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lillian.

I am a Python developer with a background in business intelligence and web design. I like to tackle interdisciplinary technical problems; my past work has been in the fields of oncology, neuroscience, and art. Bridging the gap between computer science and another field is what I enjoy the most. If your team is looking for an adaptable developer, let's chat!
